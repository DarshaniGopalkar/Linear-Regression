🏠 Housing Price Prediction — Linear Regression
This project is part of an AI & ML Internship focused on implementing simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing Price dataset.

📄 Objective
To build and evaluate linear regression models that predict house prices based on various input features like area, number of bedrooms, and more.

📋 Steps:
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Explored data using head(), info(), and describe().
3. Checked for and handled missing values.
4. Performed one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
5. Implemented Simple Linear Regression using one feature (e.g., area).
6. Plotted the regression line and visualized model fit.
7. Implemented Multiple Linear Regression using all features.
8. Evaluated models using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
9. Interpreted regression coefficients and summarized insights.
